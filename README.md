# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This week's homework assignment was to create an application that would randomly generate a password that would prompt for multiple criteria such as length, upper/lowercase, and special characers.

This was a challenging homework that I honestly am not sure I would have been able to complete without a tutor's assistance. While I have a vague grasp of their suggestions reflected in the code for this assignment, I don't believe I would've come to their conclusions on my own. Using the given html and css files, I only altered the JS file included for the homework.
